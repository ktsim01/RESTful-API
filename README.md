# RESTful-API
The goal of this project is to develop a simple REST API application that is backed by a database such as MySQL which will provide out HTTP endpoints. This involves client-server environment where clients request for resources from the server managed with HTTP. In order to build a stable API, a concurrent strategy will be employed to handle large scale requests or updates using many of the built-in features in Golang. Postman or other HTTP client will be used to test the server. Once the server works, I will try to get it working locally in Docker.
